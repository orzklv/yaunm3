[Yaunm3](https://github.com/orzklv/yaunm3) is name of a Flipper Zero a journey written by [Orzklv](https://orzklv.uz) while exploring the world of Flipper Zero. It is a series of articles that will be published on a regular basis. The articles will cover the following topics:

> <p align="center">If you run into issues while compiling & running, please consider leaving issues on this repository. Would be glad to work on them together.</p>

## Getting started

First, clone the repo anywhere in your computer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/orzklv/yaunm3.git
```

If you want to patch firmware, check out `firmware` directory. It's highly recommended to read the ReadMe file to get to know how to compile and flash the firmware.

## Options

Duckquill offers some configuration options to make it fit you better; most options have pretty descriptive comments, so it should be easy to understand what they do.

### Custom stylesheets

You can add your own or override existing styles by creating custom stylesheet and adding it in the `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
stylesheets = [
  "YOUR_STYLE.css"
]
```

Additional stylesheets; expects it to be in the `static` directory. If you are using Sass it will be compiled there anyway.

If for some reason overridden class are not respected, try using `!important`. You can import styles from Duckquill using:

```scss
@use "../themes/duckquill/sass/NEEDED_FILE.scss";
```

### Primary color

Duckquill respects chosen primary color everywhere, simply change the primary color in `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
primary_color = "COLOR_CODE"
primary_color_alpha = "COLOR_CODE"
```
